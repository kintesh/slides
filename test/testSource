# Text
------

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

This is the 2nd paragraph. Text styles *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace` and ~~Strikethrough~~.

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.


> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

# Lists
-------

Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note: that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

# Lists (2)
-------

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

# Maths
-------

Inline math equations go in like so: $ \omega = d\phi / dt $. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$ I = \int \rho R^{2} dV $$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
